# Multitape Non Deterministic Turing Machine Simulator
An accept-state seeking multitape non deterministic Turing machine simulator allows you to write and execute any Turing machine program with respect to **Syntax** and no constraints on the amount of tapes.

## Getting Started
To obtain a copy of the simulator just download Turing Machine.jar
